When working with a 14-bit grayscale UVC camera in Python using OpenCV, you might encounter issues where the image intensities (grayscale values) do not display correctly. This happens because OpenCV's `VideoCapture` interface may not fully support high bit-depth grayscale formats like 14-bit, and by default, it expects 8-bit images. The Windows Camera app, on the other hand, might handle the camera's specific pixel format correctly, which is why it displays the image properly.

### **Understanding the Issue**

1. **Pixel Format Compatibility**: UVC cameras can output images in various pixel formats. A 14-bit grayscale camera might output data in formats such as `Y14`, `Y16`, or other manufacturer-specific formats. OpenCV's `VideoCapture` may not natively support these formats, leading to incorrect interpretation of the image data.

2. **Bit Depth Handling**: OpenCV is optimized for 8-bit per channel images. When a higher bit-depth image is read, OpenCV might truncate the data or misinterpret the pixel values, resulting in images that appear incorrect (e.g., overly dark, washed out, or with incorrect intensities).

### **Solutions**

To resolve this issue, you can try the following approaches:

#### **1. Determine the Camera's Supported Pixel Formats**

First, find out what pixel formats your camera supports. You can use tools like VLC media player, `v4l2-ctl` (on Linux), or software provided by the camera manufacturer to list the supported formats. Alternatively, you can query the camera's capabilities programmatically.

#### **2. Set the Desired Pixel Format in OpenCV**

You can attempt to set the video capture's pixel format to match one that OpenCV can handle. For example, if your camera supports an 8-bit grayscale format (`Y8`), you can configure it to use that format:

```python
import cv2

# Open the camera with the desired device index (e.g., 0)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)  # Use CAP_DSHOW on Windows

# Set the frame width and height if needed
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)

# Try setting the pixel format to 'Y8' (8-bit grayscale)
# This step might not work if the camera or driver does not support changing the format via OpenCV
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'Y800'))  # 'Y800' is a common FourCC code for 8-bit grayscale

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to grab frame")
        break

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Camera', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
        break  # Press 'Esc' to exit

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Note that setting the FourCC code might not work due to driver limitations. If `cap.read()` continues to return frames with incorrect pixel values, this indicates that OpenCV cannot handle the camera's pixel format directly.

#### **3. Use Manufacturer's SDK or Libraries**

Camera manufacturers often provide SDKs or APIs that support all features of their cameras, including high bit-depth formats. Check if the manufacturer offers a Python API or a C/C++ SDK that you can wrap with Python using tools like `ctypes` or `cffi`.

#### **4. Use Alternative Libraries**

Consider using other libraries that support high bit-depth image acquisition. For example:

- **DirectShow** (on Windows): You can use the `pydshow` package or `Media Foundation` APIs to access the camera and read the frames in the desired format.

- **PyUSB** or **libusb**: If the camera can be accessed via USB as a bulk device, you might be able to read the raw data directly.

- **GStreamer**: A powerful multimedia framework that can handle various media types and formats. You can use it in Python with the `gi` module.

#### **5. Manual Data Handling**

If you can get the raw data buffer from the camera, you can handle the 14-bit data manually. This involves:

- Reading the raw frame data into a buffer.
- Interpreting the buffer correctly to extract the 14-bit pixel values.
- Scaling or converting the data to a format suitable for display or further processing.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming 'frame_data' is the raw data buffer obtained from the camera
# For a 14-bit image, you might have to read it as uint16 and handle the bit depth

# Convert raw data to a NumPy array
frame_array = np.frombuffer(frame_data, dtype=np.uint16)

# Reshape to match the image dimensions
frame_array = frame_array.reshape((height, width))

# Normalize or scale the image for display
frame_normalized = (frame_array / 2**14 * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# Display using OpenCV
cv2.imshow('Camera', frame_normalized)
```

#### **6. Contact the Manufacturer**

If none of the above methods work, consider reaching out to the camera manufacturer. They might provide:

- Custom drivers that expose the camera data in a format compatible with OpenCV.
- Documentation on how to interpret the raw data.
- Example code or libraries for acquiring and processing images from the camera.

### **Summary**

- OpenCV's `VideoCapture` may not support 14-bit grayscale images directly.
- Try setting the camera to output in an 8-bit format if possible.
- Use the camera manufacturer's SDK or APIs for full compatibility.
- Manually handle the raw data if you can access it.
- Explore alternative libraries like GStreamer or DirectShow for advanced capture capabilities.

By using the appropriate method to access and interpret the camera's data, you should be able to display and process the images correctly in Python.

Based on the information you've provided, your camera supports the following pixel formats:

- `pixel_format=yuyv422` at 640x512 resolution and 25 fps
- `vcodec=mjpeg` at 640x512 resolution and 25 fps

When using OpenCV's `VideoCapture`, directly capturing from a camera that outputs in `YUYV422` format can lead to issues, as OpenCV may not handle this format properly by default. This can result in incorrect display of colors or grayscale intensities.

To address this issue, you can configure your code to match one of the supported pixel formats of your camera. Here's how you can modify your code to correctly read and display the camera feed:

### **Option 1: Use MJPEG Format**

First, try setting your camera to use the MJPEG format, which is more widely supported and may work correctly with OpenCV's defaults.

```python
import cv2

# Open the camera using the appropriate backend (CAP_DSHOW on Windows)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)

# Set the desired frame width and height
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 512)

# Set the video codec to MJPEG
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG')  # FourCC code for MJPEG
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC, fourcc)

# Optionally set the frames per second
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 25)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Cannot open camera")
    exit()

# Read and display frames from the camera
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Cannot receive frame. Exiting ...")
        break

    # Optionally convert to grayscale if the camera is monochrome
    # gray_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # cv2.imshow('Camera Feed', gray_frame)

    # Display the frame as is (might be in color due to MJPEG encoding)
    cv2.imshow('Camera Feed', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the capture and close windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Set FourCC to MJPEG**: By setting the FourCC code to `'MJPG'`, you instruct OpenCV to request the camera to deliver frames in the MJPEG format, which it should handle correctly.

- **Display the Frames**: You can display the frames directly. If the camera is grayscale, you might need to convert the frames to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor`.

### **Option 2: Handle YUYV422 Format Manually**

If the MJPEG format doesn't work, or if you prefer to use the `YUYV422` format, you'll need to read the frames and convert them properly, as OpenCV might not handle `YUYV422` correctly by default.

```python
import cv2

# Open the camera using the appropriate backend
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)

# Set the desired frame width and height
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 512)

# Set the video codec to YUY2 (YUYV422)
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'YUY2')
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC, fourcc)

# Optionally set the frames per second
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 25)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Cannot open camera")
    exit()

# Read and display frames from the camera
while True:
    ret, raw_frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Cannot receive frame. Exiting ...")
        break

    # Convert the frame from YUYV422 to BGR format
    bgr_frame = cv2.cvtColor(raw_frame, cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR_YUY2)

    # For grayscale images, convert to grayscale
    gray_frame = cv2.cvtColor(bgr_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Display the grayscale frame
    cv2.imshow('Camera Feed', gray_frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the capture and close windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Set FourCC to YUY2**: By setting the FourCC code to `'YUY2'`, you request frames in the `YUYV422` pixel format.

- **Convert Frames Properly**: OpenCV's `cvtColor` function can convert the raw `YUYV422` frames to BGR format using `cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR_YUY2`. Since your camera is grayscale, you can then convert the BGR image to grayscale using `cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY`.

- **Display the Frame**: After conversion, display the frame using `cv2.imshow`.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check Camera Index**: Ensure that the camera index (`0` in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`) corresponds to your camera. If you have multiple cameras connected, you may need to change this index.

- **Verify Frame Properties**: You can print out the frame properties to verify that the settings have been applied:

  ```python
  print("Frame width:", cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
  print("Frame height:", cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
  print("FPS:", cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
  fourcc_value = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC)
  codec = "".join([chr((int(fourcc_value) >> 8 * i) & 0xFF) for i in range(4)])
  print("Codec:", codec)
  ```

- **Adjust Brightness and Contrast**: If the grayscale image still doesn't display correctly, you might need to adjust the brightness and contrast:

  ```python
  # Adjust the contrast and brightness
  alpha = 1.5  # Contrast factor
  beta = 0     # Brightness factor
  adjusted_frame = cv2.convertScaleAbs(gray_frame, alpha=alpha, beta=beta)
  cv2.imshow('Adjusted Camera Feed', adjusted_frame)
  ```

- **Handle 14-bit Data**: If your camera outputs 14-bit grayscale data packed into 16 bits, OpenCV might interpret it incorrectly. OpenCV typically handles 8-bit or 16-bit images. If needed, you can manually process the raw data:

  ```python
  # Assuming raw_frame is a NumPy array of type uint16
  # Shift the data to use the most significant bits
  shifted_frame = (raw_frame >> 2).astype(np.uint8)
  cv2.imshow('Shifted Camera Feed', shifted_frame)
  ```

  However, this may not be necessary if the camera outputs data in a format compatible with OpenCV after conversion.

### **Summary**

- **Try Using MJPEG Format**: Set the camera to output frames in MJPEG format by setting the FourCC code to `'MJPG'`.

- **Handle YUYV422 Format Manually**: If MJPEG doesn't work, set the FourCC code to `'YUY2'` and convert the frames from `YUYV422` to grayscale using OpenCV's `cvtColor` function.

- **Adjust Frame Properties**: Ensure that the frame width, height, and FPS are correctly set.

- **Check Frame Data**: If issues persist, inspect the frame data (min/max values, data type) and adjust the image accordingly.

- **Consult Manufacturer's Documentation**: If problems continue, refer to your camera's documentation or contact the manufacturer for specific guidance on handling 14-bit grayscale data.

By configuring your code to match the camera's supported pixel formats and properly converting the frames, you should be able to display the grayscale images correctly.

The issue you're experiencing stems from how OpenCV's `VideoCapture` class handles image data from cameras, especially when dealing with non-standard formats like 14-bit grayscale images. Here's a detailed explanation and steps to resolve the problem:

### **Understanding the Issue**

1. **Bit Depth Handling in OpenCV**:
   - OpenCV's `VideoCapture` is primarily designed to handle standard image formats, typically 8-bit per channel images.
   - When it encounters a camera outputting higher bit-depth images (like 14-bit), it may not interpret the data correctly.
   - This can lead to improper scaling or truncation of pixel values, causing dark areas to appear white or other visual anomalies.

2. **Camera Output Format**:
   - Your camera outputs 14-bit grayscale images, likely packed into 16-bit data per pixel.
   - Over UVC (USB Video Class), the data may be sent in a proprietary or less common format that `VideoCapture` doesn't natively support.
   - The Windows camera app working fine suggests it handles or converts the data appropriately, possibly using specific drivers or APIs.

### **Steps to Resolve the Problem**

#### **1. Verify the Camera's Output Format**

- **Check Camera Documentation**:
  - Identify the exact pixel format used by the camera over UVC. Common formats include:
    - **Y16**: 16-bit grayscale.
    - **GREY**: Standard 8-bit grayscale.
  - Determine if the camera uses any compression or packing for the 14-bit data.

- **List Supported Formats Programmatically**:
  - While OpenCV doesn't provide a direct method, you can use third-party tools or code to list supported formats.
  - On Windows, you can use [DirectShow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directshow/directshow) or [Media Foundation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/media-foundation-start-page) APIs to enumerate available camera formats.

#### **2. Use a Compatible Backend in OpenCV**

- **Select the Appropriate Backend**:
  - Use backends like `CAP_DSHOW` (DirectShow) or `CAP_MSMF` (Media Foundation) which might offer more control.
  - Example:
    ```python
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_MSMF)
    ```
  
- **Set the Desired Pixel Format**:
  - You might be able to set the video capture properties to request a specific pixel format.
  - Use `cap.set()` function to set properties like frame width, height, and pixel format.

  - Example:
    ```python
    # Attempt to set the camera to output Y16 format
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_CONVERT_RGB, 0)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'Y16 '))
    ```

  - **Note**: Support for setting these properties varies by camera and driver. The above code may not work if the camera doesn't recognize the request or if the backend doesn't support it.

#### **3. Access Raw Data if Possible**

- **Read Frames and Inspect Data**:
  - Capture a frame using `cap.read()` and check the data type and values:
    ```python
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    print(frame.dtype)  # Check data type
    print(frame.shape)  # Check dimensions
    print(np.min(frame), np.max(frame))  # Check pixel value range
    ```
  - If `frame.dtype` is `uint8`, OpenCV is reading 8-bit data, so higher bits are being truncated.

- **Attempt to Read 16-bit Data**:
  - OpenCV may not directly support 16-bit grayscale in `VideoCapture`, but you can try:
    ```python
    # Try to read as 16-bit data
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FORMAT, cv2.CV_16UC1)
    ```
  - **Warning**: This approach is unlikely to work due to limitations in OpenCV's `VideoCapture`.

#### **4. Use the Camera's SDK or API**

- **Manufacturer's SDK**:
  - Most camera manufacturers provide SDKs or APIs specifically designed to interface with their hardware.
  - Advantages:
    - Full access to camera features, including special pixel formats.
    - Sample code and documentation tailored for the camera.
  - Actions:
    - Download the SDK from the manufacturer's website.
    - Install any required drivers.
    - Use provided libraries (often in C/C++ or .NET) to capture images.
    - Interface with Python using wrappers or via C extensions.

- **Python Wrappers**:
  - If the SDK provides C/C++ libraries, you can create Python bindings using tools like [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) or [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).

#### **5. Use Alternative Libraries**

- **PyDirectShow or PyMediaFoundation**:
  - Libraries that provide Python bindings to Windows media APIs.
  - **PyDirectShow**: Access the camera using DirectShow interfaces.
  - **PyMediaFoundation**: Use Media Foundation to capture high bit-depth images.

- **Example with Media Foundation**:
  - Use Microsoft's [Media Foundation .NET](https://mfnet.sourceforge.net/) (for C#) and interface with Python via [Python.NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/).

- **Third-Party Libraries**:
  - Some libraries are designed for scientific imaging and support high bit-depth images, e.g., [Pylon](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/) for Basler cameras.

#### **6. Process the Captured Data Appropriately**

- **Scaling Pixel Values**:
  - If you manage to capture the 14-bit data, you'll get pixel values ranging from 0 to 16383.
  - To display or save the image, you might need to scale it down to 8-bit (0-255):
    ```python
    # Assuming 'frame' contains 14-bit data
    frame_8bit = (frame / 64).astype('uint8')  # Divide by 64 to scale 0-16383 to 0-255
    ```

- **Inverting the Image**:
  - If higher pixel values represent darker areas, invert the image:
    ```python
    frame_inverted = 16383 - frame  # For 14-bit data
    ```

- **Visualization**:
  - Use matplotlib or OpenCV's highGUI to display the scaled image.

#### **7. Check for Driver or Firmware Updates**

- **Update Camera Drivers**:
  - Ensure that the latest drivers are installed, which might add support for standard formats.

- **Firmware Update**:
  - Check if a firmware update is available for the camera that might improve compatibility.

### **Example Code Using the Camera's SDK**

Below is a hypothetical example (since the actual SDK and functions will vary):

```python
# Import the camera's SDK module
import camera_sdk

# Initialize the camera
cam = camera_sdk.Camera()

# Configure the camera settings if necessary
cam.set_pixel_format('Y16')  # Setting to 16-bit grayscale

# Capture an image
frame = cam.capture_frame()

# Convert to NumPy array if not already
import numpy as np
frame_data = np.array(frame, dtype='uint16')

# Process the image (e.g., scaling to 8-bit for display)
frame_8bit = (frame_data / 64).astype('uint8')

# Display the image using OpenCV
import cv2
cv2.imshow('Camera Frame', frame_8bit)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### **Conclusion**

The root of your problem is the mismatch between the camera's output format and what OpenCV's `VideoCapture` expects. Since `VideoCapture` doesn't natively support 14-bit or 16-bit grayscale images over UVC, the best solution is to use the camera's SDK or a library that gives you low-level access to the camera data.

### **Next Steps**

- **Obtain the Camera SDK**: Visit the manufacturer's website and download the SDK.
- **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with functions to capture and process images.
- **Implement the SDK in Python**: Use provided examples and adapt them to your needs.
- **Process and Display Images**: Once you can capture the raw data, apply any necessary processing to visualize it correctly.
